Current issues and proposed revisions
-------------------------------------

This text is approaching stability, yet remains under active, albeit intermittent, revision. The current public version of the text is stable for summer term 2020, as it is being used as a textbook in our *Introduction to Logic* course. 

I welcome comments, notification of errors and typos, and any new ideas: [antony.eagle@adelaide.edu.au](mailto:antony.eagle@adelaide.edu.au?subject=forallx-adl). I will update this readme with a list of issues and proposed changes. But I will not push changes until the course is over. 

The following list contains current issues and proposed revisions arranged by chapter:

* Chapter 1 (`forallx-adl-what.tex`) 
* Chapter 2 (`forallx-adl-tfl.tex`)
* Chapter 3 (`forallx-adl-truthtables.tex`)
* Chapter 4 (`forallx-adl-fol.tex`)
* Chapter 5 (`forallx-adl-interpretations.tex`)
* Chapter 6 (`forallx-adl-prooftfl.tex`)
* Chapter 7 (`forallx-adl-prooffol.tex`)
* Backmatter
* Other
	- The LaTeX package `filehook-scrlfile.sty` is currently (2019-12-03) causing problems with the `memoir` and `unicode-math` packages used in the book after an update to the LaTeX kernel; see [this StackExchange discussion](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/513051/filehook-error-with-memoir-after-update-texlive-2019-in-oct-15). Hopefully this is temporary, but at present getting the LaTeX to compile is a bit fiddly.
