Current issues and proposed revisions
-------------------------------------

This text is under active yet sporadic revision. The list of items below is primarily for me, and some of it is rather cryptic, but it may be useful for readers to see proposed changes.

* Chapter 1 (`forallx-adl-what.tex`) 
* Chapter 2 (`forallx-adl-tfl.tex`)
* Chapter 3 (`forallx-adl-truthtables.tex`)
* Chapter 4 (`forallx-adl-fol.tex`)
* Chapter 5 (`forallx-adl-interpretations.tex`)
* Chapter 6 (`forallx-adl-prooftfl.tex`)
	* Do more to motivate understanding of making assumptions in the course of argument – a discussion about making and discharging assumptions in general.
	* refine disjunction elim
	* Modify negation rules to involve the derivation of an explicit contradiction *within* the scope of the assumption? Should we use DS for disjunction elimination?
		* Con: both ideas destroy the nice feature of the rules that only one connective is used in any rule, which means that can be discussed separately from one another.
		* Pro: dispense with subproofs for disjunction elimination (proof by cases); elimation rule produces a constituent of original sentence, rather than some new 'C'. 
	* And maybe note some structural rules explicitly: e.g., that A, B ⊦ A ∧ B and A, B ⊦ B ∧ A$, etc.
	* Give an official introduction to the idea of how to prove an argument in ND – i.e., how to apply the proof system after symbolisation of an argument.
	* return to arguments introduced in §27 once we have all the rules.
	* key ideas for §27 and §28, exercises for §28
	* clean up exercises to make sure they only use the proper rules
* Chapter 7 (`forallx-adl-prooffol.tex`)
* Backmatter
* Everywhere
	* Incorporate JO tutorial questions into text ch. 6
