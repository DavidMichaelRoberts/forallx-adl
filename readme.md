Current issues and proposed revisions
-------------------------------------

This text is under active yet sporadic revision. The current public version of the text is stable for semester 2 2019, as it is being used as a textbook in our *Introduction to Logic* course, and we wish to ensure that students are working from a consistent text.

I will be updating my private version of the text in response to comments, typos, and any new ideas. I will updating this document with a list of issues and proposed changes. But no changes will be made until semester is over.

The following list contains current issues and proposed revisions arranged by chapter:

* Chapter 1 (`forallx-adl-what.tex`) 
* Chapter 2 (`forallx-adl-tfl.tex`)
* Chapter 3 (`forallx-adl-truthtables.tex`)
* Chapter 4 (`forallx-adl-fol.tex`)
* Chapter 5 (`forallx-adl-interpretations.tex`)
* Chapter 6 (`forallx-adl-prooftfl.tex`)
* Chapter 7 (`forallx-adl-prooffol.tex`)
* Backmatter
